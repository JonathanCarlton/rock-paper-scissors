// need function to select the computers choice
// this need to be a randomized 1 in 3 chance to select either Rock (1) Paper (2) or Scissors (3)
// we can use a random number generator and a swich case statement to assign each of the values

// need a function to get the users input. 
// user will be prompted to enter their selection. Either Rock (1), Paper (2), or Scissors (3).
// this will need to account for both lowercase and uppercase characters

// with the computers choice selected and the players choise selected, we need to compare the two to determine which one is the winner
// the rules are, Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock.
// in the event that both players select the same choice it will be a draw and there will be no winner.

// add a button allowing the player to play again and choose a new selection. This will also trigger the computer to roll for a new selection.

// Extra: Could include a tally system, that could be used to keep track of the number of wins. ex best 2 of 3, best 3 of 5 etc.
// Would also need a reset button to reset the current score (or reset on page refresh)
